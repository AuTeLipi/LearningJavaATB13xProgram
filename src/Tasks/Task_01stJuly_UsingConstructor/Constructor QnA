//--------------------------------------------------- Constructor Interview QnA ---------------------------------------------------//

1. What is a constructor in Java?
Ans: Constructor is a special function, it is invoked or automatically called when an object is initialized / created.
-	Class Name and Constructor name should be same.
-	It doesn’t have return type even void.

Imagine:
•	Class = Blueprint for a person
•	Constructor = Brahma (the creator)
•	Object = A person Brahma creates

2. How is a constructor different from a method?

Constructor:
Feature	       | Description
Purpose	       |  Used to initialize a new object.
Name           |  Must have the same name as the class.
Return Type	   |  No return type, not even void.
Call           |  Called automatically when an object is created using new.
Overloading	   |  Can be overloaded (multiple constructors with different parameters).
Inheritance	   |  Not inherited, but the subclass can call superclass constructor using super().


Method:
Feature	       | Description
Purpose	       |  Defines the behavior or functionality of an object.
Name           |  Can have any valid name.
Return Type	   |  Must have a return type (int, void, String, etc.).
Call           |  Must be called explicitly using the object or class name.
Overloading	   |  Can also be overloaded.
Inheritance	   |  Inherited by subclasses (if not private), and can be overridden.

3. What are the different types of constructors in Java?
Default Constructor / Non - parameterized Constructor:
-	No parameters.
-	Automatically provided by Java if no constructor is written.
-	Used to assign default values.
Parameterized Constructor:
-	Takes arguments to assign specific values at object creation.
Copy Constructor:
-	Creates a new object by copying values from another object.
-	Not built-in like C++, but you can define your own.

4. What is constructor overloading?
Ans: Constructor overloading means having multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists.

5. Can a constructor be final, static, or abstract?

6. Can we call a constructor explicitly inside another constructor?
Ans: Yes, we can call a constructor explicitly from another constructor using this() in Java.

7. What happens if you don’t define a constructor in a class?
Ans: If you don’t define any constructor, Java will automatically add it.

Program 1: What is a default constructor? Give one example, Write a code for that.
// Check Default_Constructor.java file

Ex: Brahma says: “Let there be a goat.”
He creates one with default settings:
•	Name = "Unknown"
•	Age = 0


Program 2: How do you create a parameterized constructor? Give one example, Write a code for that.
// Check Parameterized_Constructor.java file

Ex: Brahma creates a person:
•	Name: Sita
•	Age: 22
So, he calls the constructor with: new Person ("Sita", 22)
