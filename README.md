# 🚀 LearningJavaATB13xProgram

Welcome to my Java learning repository, built as part of the **SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)** training journey. This repository captures hands-on practice and concepts essential for mastering **Java for Automation Testing**, organized in a structured, topic-wise manner.

---

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong core Java fundamentals tailored for automation testing.
- Understand OOPs principles and Java-specific constructs from a test automation perspective.
- Prepare a reusable base of Java knowledge for Selenium, API, and framework design.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### ✅ Core Java Foundations
- `Ex01_Java_Basic` – Basic program setup, compilation, and execution.
- `Ex02_Java_Variables` – Primitive types, reference types, constants.
- `Ex03_Literals`, `Ex04_Operators`, `Ex05_Type_Casting` – Core syntax, expressions, type conversion.
- `Ex06_Ternary_Operator`, `Ex07_UserInput`, `Ex08_Increment_Decrement_Op` – Test-oriented operations.

### 🔁 Control Flow – Logic Building
- `Ex_09_If_Condition`, `Ex_10_Switch`
- `Ex_11_For_Loop`, `Ex_12_While`, `Ex_13_DoWhile`
- Great for **decision-making and looping structures in automation scripts**.

### 🧰 String and Data Handling
- `Ex_14_Strings`, `Ex_16_StringBuffer_Builder` – String manipulations used in test validations and assertions.

### 🌐 OOPs – Foundation for Test Framework Design
- `Ex_18_OOPs` to `Ex_27_Instance_Initialization_Block`:
  - **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**
  - Key for **Page Object Model**, **TestNG/JUnit design**, and **clean framework architecture**

### ⚙️ Java Internals for Testers
- `Ex_28_Static`, `Ex_29_ENUM`, `Ex_30_Wrapper_Class`
- `Ex_31_Exceptions`, `Ex_32_Generics`
- Concepts often overlooked but critical in **robust test design** and **exception handling**.

### 🧮 Collections & DSA (for test data handling)
- `Ex_33_Collection_Framework_DSA` – Hands-on with **List**, **Set**, **Map** and data-driven testing patterns.

## 🧪 Why This Matters for Automation Testing

As an aspiring SDET, having a solid grip on Java empowers you to:
- Build maintainable and scalable test automation frameworks.
- Understand backend APIs and integrate validations.
- Handle dynamic web elements, custom waits, and exception scenarios in Selenium.
- Contribute meaningfully to codebases using OOPs principles.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Java Version**: Java 17 (Recommended)
- **Build Tool**: Maven (for future test project integration)
